# SaveInstance-AndroidStudio
Save instance so after changing configuration(orientation) app can relocate them again and protect from data loss.
I have taken the code from the Two Activities.
And here made some changes so that we can save our instance after changing configuration(orientation of our android device).
You can see that it is working fine by replying from second activity to the first and then changing the orientation after came 
to main activity will not gonna loss that reply.
